对于一个封闭系统的平衡状态A和B，至少可以构建一个发生在这个封闭系统及其环境之间的、仅存在绝热功相互作用的过程，使这个封闭系统从状态A变化到状态B，或从状态B变化到状态A。这个过程需要的功或产生的功的大小，仅由系统状态A和状态B决定。\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h3>绝热功</h3>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        在A和B两个封闭系统之间，如果A系统对B系统做的功可以仅用标准重力场中重物的上升或下降来重现，同时B系统对A系统做的功也可以仅用相同标准重力场中相同重量重物的下降或上升相同高度来完全重现，那么这两个系统之间的相互作用为绝热功相互作用。<br>\r\n                        绝热功由系统的状态决定，是状态量。\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <h3>具体示例</h3>\r\n                        <p> \r\n                            <strong>示例1</strong><br><br>\r\n                            <img src=\"../../../public/img/basic/post_3rd1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"pic\"><br>\r\n                            如图所示，系统A是装有0℃水的绝热容器，系统B是缠绕着重物的转子。重物下落时，转子转动对系统A做功。因为过程中B系统的变化为标准重力场中重物的下降，因此B系统对A系统做的功符合绝热功条件。<br>\r\n                            将A系统用与B系统相同的转子和重物替代，称为系统B'，如图所示：<br>\r\n                            <img src=\"../../../public/img/basic/post_3rd2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"pic\"><br>\r\n                            可以看出，系统B'中，重物下降相同的距离就可以将系统B中重物提升到原位置，即系统A对系统B所做的功也可以通过重物在重力场中的下降来实现，也符合绝热功条件。所以这个重物下落过程是绝热功过程。<br><br>\r\n                        <strong>示例2</strong><br><br>\r\n                        <img src=\"../../../public/img/basic/post_3rd3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"pic\"><br>\r\n                            如图所示，绝热容器A内部有透热膜，将容器分为左侧的冰水混合物（冰始终存在）和右侧的0℃纯水。系统B为重物和转子，重物在重力场中下落，带动转子对0℃的水做功。如果将透热膜左侧的冰水混合物定义为系统A'，0℃水和重物转子定义为系统B'，则A与B之间、A'与B'之间是否为绝热功过程？<br><br>\r\n                            AB系统：<br>\r\n                            与示例1相同，为绝热功过程。<br>\r\n                            A'B'系统：<br>\r\n                            B'通过导热使A'中的冰融化，相当于重物下降的功转化为冰的熔化热；但A'系统对B'系统做功必须通过热传递（系统A'和B'由透热膜分隔这一约束条件不能改变），而热转化为功存在转化效率的极限，即无法通过相同的重物在相同重力场中的下落使B'恢复到起始状态。所以这一过程对于系统A'B'而言并非绝热功过程。\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <h3>第三基本假设意义</h3>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        通过第三基本假设，我们可以引出能量差的定义：<br>\r\n                        系统状态A和状态B之间的能量差即等于封闭系统状态A和状态B变化所需要的绝热功的大小。<br>\r\n                        由于绝热功只与系统初末状态有关，所以能量差也只与系统状态有关，与过程无关。在实际应用中，通常将能量进一步划分为动能、势能和内能。<br>\r\n                        \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h3>内能和热</h3>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        对于一个过程，使系统从状态A变化到状态B，由第三基本假设可以得到方程：\r\n                        <math>\\underline E_B-\\underline E_A=W^a_{A\\rightarrow B}</math>\r\n                        其中<math inline=1>W^a_{A\\rightarrow B}</math>表示从状态A到状态B的绝热功。<br>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h4>内能</h4>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        对于一个简单系统，系统内能就等于能量，为状态量。如果以状态A为参比态，过程的绝热功就等于状态B的内能（对于简单系统而言）。结合第一基本假设可知，系统内能U可以用两个独立变化的性质和物质的量完全描述。<br>\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h4>热</h4>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        我们定义AB状态分别为初末状态，即：\r\n                        <math>\\underline E_A \\equiv \\underline E_{initial},\\;\\underline E_B \\equiv \\underline E_{final}</math>\r\n                        对于一个绝热过程，外界对系统做的功W就等于绝热功。<br>\r\n                        而对于一个非绝热过程，W不等于绝热功，即：\r\n                        <math>\\underline E_{final} -\\underline E_{initial} = W^a_{initial\\rightarrow final} \\neq W</math>\r\n                        于是我们定义热Q：\r\n                        <math>Q=\\underline E_{final} -\\underline E_{initial}-W=W^a_{initial\\rightarrow final}-W</math>\r\n                        其中，当外界对系统传热时Q为正值，当外界对系统做功时W为正值。\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <md-button

令其中两个状态点为i'f'，构建的卡诺循环为g'h'b'a'；因为i'和f'无限接近，所以可以认为g'h'段温度等于i'的温度等于f'的温度；c'd'段同理。得到：\r\n                        <math>\\frac{\\delta Q_{i'f'}}{T_{i'f'}}+\\frac{\\delta Q_{c'd'}}{T_{c'd'}}=0</math>\r\n

将理想气体状态方程pV=RT代入可以发现：\r\n                            <math class=\"ms\">\\left(\\frac {\\partial U}{\\partial p}\\right)_T=-T\\left(\\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_p-p\\left(\\frac

孤立系统中理想气体自由扩散，因为分子间无引力所以内能不变，温度不变，不做功不吸热。（因为热力学函数计算式只适用于平衡态间的计算，所以自由扩散过程的内能变化无法由这些方程计算；只能由非平衡热力学或者微观状态获得。）<br><br>\r\n                            3. 孤立系统中真实气体自由扩散。扩散后，分子间相互作用势能减小，但孤立系统内能守恒（可视为分子间相互作用势能+分子动能），所以温度应该会上升，使分子动能上升。<br><br>\r\n                            4. 等焓下气体膨胀，即为节流过程。\r\n                            <math class=\"ms\">\\mu \\equiv \\left(\\frac {\\partial T}{\\partial p}\\right)_H=-\\left(\\frac {\\partial T}{\\partial H}\\right)_p\\left(\\frac {\\partial H}{\\partial p}\\right)_T=-\\frac 1{C_p}\\left[V-T\\left(\\frac

承接3，想象真实气体在一个活塞内，无摩擦，外侧是真空；以气体和活塞为系统，整个过程中能量不会耗散到系统外部。为方便想象，令活塞有质量m。<br>\r\n                            因为有了活塞这一个“平面”，拔掉固定物后，在两侧的压差下活塞有了速度。于是在运动过程中，气体分子间势能的减小可以转化为活塞的动能，气体温度可能下降。当活塞撞上一段距离外的固定物后，无能量损失回弹；这段来回运动的过程省略，最终状态下活塞静止。此时，活塞的动能完全返回给气体，相当于3的情况；因此气体温度相比初态应该会上升。<br>\r\n                            以上过程能量转化上应该相当于将流体的焓转变为动能再转变为热。<br><br>\r\n                            同理，即使抵抗外压绝热做功，如果外压不够高，真实气体虽然内能下降，温度却不一定会下降。仿照节流过程计算，可以得到前后平衡态温度随压力的变化：\r\n                            <math>\\left(\\frac

           引入理想对比体积<math inline=1>V_{ri}</math>:\r\n                        <math>V_{ri}=V_rZ_c</math>\r\n                        在理想气体状态方程中引入压缩因子Z以描述真实气体：\r\n                        <math>pV=ZRT</math>\r\n                        由实验数据得到，在一定精度范围内，可以考虑Z为<math inline=1>p_r,T_r</math>的函数，即令<math inline=1>Z=Z(p_r,T_r)</math>;<br>\r\n                        将对比参数代入上式得到：\r\n                        <math>p_rV_r=\\frac{Z}{Z_c}T_r</math>\r\n                        再引入理想对比体积，得到方程：\r\n                        <math class=\"em\">p_rV_{ri}=ZT_r</math>\r\n                        其中，<math
