      热机中，变热为功的过程总是伴随着工质的膨胀（膨胀过程才能对外做功）；但是要用有限的工质使热机连续产生大量的功，就需要使膨胀后的工质经由其他热力学过程恢复到初态，然后再次膨胀。工质经历一系列状态变化后恢复初态，热力学上称为完成了一个“热力循环”。<br>\r\n                        根据效果，循环分为正向和逆向。正向循环使热能转变为机械能，每次循环产生机械功如图a中阴影面积所示；所有热机都是正向循环。逆向循环通过消耗机械能使热量从低温向高温流动，这部分机械能转化为热能送往高温处；每次循环消耗机械功如图b阴影面积所示；制冷机、热泵等工作原理即为逆向循环。<br>\r\n                        <img

将理想气体状态方程pV=RT代入可以发现：\r\n                            <math class=\"ms\">\\left(\\frac {\\partial U}{\\partial p}\\right)_T=-T\\left(\\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_p-p\\left(\\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial p}\\right)_T=0</math>\r\n                            即验证了理想气体内能只与温度有关。<br><br>    \r\n                            2. 孤立系统中理想气体自由扩散，因为分子间无引力所以内能不变，温度不变，不做功不吸热。（因为热力学函数计算式只适用于平衡态间的计算，所以自由扩散过程的内能变化无法由这些方程计算；只能由非平衡热力学或者微观状态获得。）<br><br>\r\n                            3. 孤立系统中真实气体自由扩散。扩散后，分子间相互作用势能减小，但孤立系统内能守恒（可视为分子间相互作用势能+分子动能），所以温度应该会上升，使分子动能上升。<br><br>\r\n                            4. 等焓下气体膨胀，即为节流过程。\r\n                            <math class=\"ms\">\\mu \\equiv \\left(\\frac {\\partial T}{\\partial p}\\right)_H=-\\left(\\frac {\\partial T}{\\partial H}\\right)_p\\left(\\frac {\\partial H}{\\partial p}\\right)_T=-\\frac 1{C_p}\\left[V-T\\left(\\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_p\\right]</math>\r\n                            方程表示节流前后的两个平衡态下，流体温度可能上升可能下降，与温度、压力、流体种类有关。<br><br>\r\n                            5. 承接3，想象真实气体在一个活塞内，无摩擦，外侧是真空；以气体和活塞为系统，整个过程中能量不会耗散到系统外部。为方便想象，令活塞有质量m。<br>\r\n                            因为有了活塞这一个“平面”，拔掉固定物后，在两侧的压差下活塞有了速度。于是在运动过程中，气体分子间势能的减小可以转化为活塞的动能，气体温度可能下降。当活塞撞上一段距离外的固定物后，无能量损失回弹；这段来回运动的过程省略，最终状态下活塞静止。此时，活塞的动能完全返回给气体，相当于3的情况；因此气体温度相比初态应该会上升。<br>\r\n                            以上过程能量转化上应该相当于将流体的焓转变为动能再转变为热。<br><br>\r\n                            同理，即使抵抗外压绝热做功，如果外压不够高，真实气体虽然内能下降，温度却不一定会下降。仿照节流过程计算，可以得到前后平衡态温度随压力的变化：\r\n                            <math>\\left(\\frac {\\partial T}{\\partial p}\\right)_U=-\\left(\\frac {\\partial T}{\\partial U}\\right)_p\\left(\\frac {\\partial U}{\\partial p}\\right)_T=\\frac 1{C_p-p\\left(\\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_p}\\left[T\\left(\\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_p+p\\left(\\frac {\\partial V}{\\partial p}\\right)_T\\right]</math>\r\n\r\n                            而理想气体绝热做功温度必然下降。<br>\r\n

<math>(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\underline L})_{\\underline S}>0</math>\r\n                        同时，定长下熵随温度升高而增大，即：\r\n                        <math>(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\underline

<math>\\delta=\\frac{c\\rho}{T^3},\\;A=A_0(1-a\\rho),\\;B=B_0(1-b\\rho)</math>\r\n                            <math inline=1>A_0,B_0,a,b,c</math>为实验得到的物性参数。<br>\r\n                            BB方程的维里展开式形式为：\r\n                            <math>p=\\frac {RT}V+\\frac{\\beta}{V^2}+\\frac{\\gamma}{V^3}+\\frac{\\delta}{V^4}</math>\r\n                            其中：\r\n                            <math>\\beta=RTB_0-A_0-\\frac{cR}{T^2}</math>\r\n                            <math>\\gamma=-RTB_0b+A_0a-\\frac{cRB_0}{T^2}</math>\r\n                            <math>\\delta=\\frac{RB_0bc}{T^2}</math>\r\n                            <br>\r\n                            方程推导：<br>\r\n                            理想气体中，分子运动所产生的压力为ρRT，但当分子之间作用力不能忽略时，需要进行修正。考虑真实气体的压力p等于热压力<math inline=1>p_{4}</math>与内压力<math inline=1>p_i</math>之差。<br>\r\n                            Beattie和Bridgeman根据Lorentz观点，认为真实气体的热压力总是大于理想气体的压力，而且分子体积越大，气体密度越高，则热压力就越大。因此<math inline=1>p_th</math>可以表示成密度的函数：\r\n                            <math>p_{th}=\\rho RT(1+Bp)</math>\r\n                            高密度时，进一步认为B是密度的函数，于是得到：\r\n                            <math>p_{th}=\\rho RT(1+B_0(1-b\\rho)\\rho)</math>\r\n                            同时，高密度下，由于分子间引力，分子有形成分子集团的趋向；而一个分子集团的行为相当于一个分子，所以实质上可以认为气体内实际粒子数减少而表观分子质量增大。由此，Beattie等提出摩尔气体常数修正式：\r\n                            <math>R'=R(1-\\frac{c\\rho}{T^n})</math>\r\n                            Beattie和Bridgeman研究发现，对于许多气体，n=3时能够最好地拟合。<br>\r\n                            而对于内压<math inline=1>p_i</math>，要考虑分子间作用力的影响。Lorentz找到了合适的公式表示内压：\r\n                            <math>p_i=A_0\\rho^2(1-a\\rho)</math>\r\n                            将以上公式代入<math inline=1>p=p_{th}-p_i</math>，即可得到BB方程。<br>\r\n                        </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                        <h3>Benedict-Webb-Rubin方程（BWR方程）</h3>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Benedict，Webb和Rubin在分析Beattie-Bridgeman方程特性的基础上，为使状态方程能更好地反映高密度气体和液体区的行为，使用轻烃的实测数据，沿等密度线研究了压力与温度的关系直到高密度区，结果找到了适合气液两相的、形式与Beattie-Bridgeman方程类同的状态方程，\r\n                            如下所示：\r\n

Laar方程计算得到。因现在的浓度范围是<math inline=1>x_1</math>较小，<math inline=1>x_2</math>较大，此时<math inline=1>\\gamma_2</math>值较接近于1，故用近似的配偶参数进行计算不会引起较大的误差。此时再做<math inline=1>\\ln\\gamma_1-x_</math>1曲线，外延至<math

在压力不太高的情况下，压力的改变对液相活度系数的影响很小，可以将上式应用于恒温体系。\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <h3>活度系数表示的GD方程具体应用</h3>\r\n                        <p>\r\n
